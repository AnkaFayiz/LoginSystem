# LoginSystem
Creating Login and Register System with Python


This program will takes two inputs from user, there are username and password.

The program will do a check on user input, if user input is correct it will give the pass to user section
but if is not correct, it will direct to register section. Program will ask user to create an account by using 
username and password. 

Program will make a file by using username as a file name. It's suppose to use a database, but i don't know how to do that.


Feel free to use or edit this program to make it better :D
